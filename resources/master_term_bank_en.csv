In Web2 the user is typically considered the product (i.e their data); however, the Web3 movement is looking to flip that narrative on its head.",en,GLOSSETA-PROD,general
application/json,decentralized,"When something is referred to as being decentralized it means that particular thing is distributed, controlled and operated among many different parties with no central authority. When an application is referred to as being decentralized (i.e dApp), in its purest form it means that it's hosted by many different peer machines on a given network and its underlying data stored and served through a non-centralized blockchain. This allows the application to remain up and running forever (theoretically) since if a subset of peers go down, the remaining peers keep the application running.

application/json,proof of stake, "Proof of stake(PoS) is a consensus mechanism based on financial deposit (i.e. stake) of the native token of a given blockchain to uphold the security and integrity of that chain. Staking a specific amount of token makes one a validator for a given chain, whose responsibility it is to propose and vote on new state transitions (i.e. blocks). Validators are rewarded with the native token of the chain upon the submission of successful blocks; however, if a validator is deemed a bad actor, they are punished by losing their deposited token.",en,GLOSSETA-PROD,general

application/json,proof of history,"Proof of History (PoH) is an algorithm developed by Anatoly Yakovenko for verifying the order and passage of time between events on a blockchain (i.e. historical records) using a recursive cryptographic hashing function (aka verifiable delay function). PoH is not a consensus algorithm but rather a mechanism allowing network participants to discern the passage of time themselves instead of waiting on others to corroborate it. PoH introduces a fundamental change with respect to how other public blockchains come to agreement on the passage of time leading to optimized network effects of block confirmation times (i.e. speedier transactions). PoH is a core component of the Solana blockchain helping it excel in the areas of speed and capacity.",en,GLOSSETA-PROD,general

A centralized good or service often consolidates control, authority and access to the small group of participants that operate it; however, that often makes the small group in control a single point of failure.
