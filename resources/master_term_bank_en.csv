In Web2 the user is typically considered the product (i.e their data); however, the Web3 movement is looking to flip that narrative on its head.",en,GLOSSETA-PROD,general
application/json,decentralized,"When something is referred to as being decentralized it means that particular thing is distributed, controlled and operated among many different parties with no central authority. When an application is referred to as being decentralized (i.e dApp), in its purest form it means that it's hosted by many different peer machines on a given network and its underlying data stored and served through a non-centralized blockchain. This allows the application to remain up and running forever (theoretically) since if a subset of peers go down, the remaining peers keep the application running. Thus, the application becomes resistant to censorship and the common pitfalls of Web2.",en,GLOSSETA-PROD,general

application/json,proof of work,"Proof of work is a consensus mechanism used to uphold the security and integrity of a blockchain, most famously for the Bitcoin protocol. Proof of work sets peers in the network against each other in a game to see who can correctly solve a computationally intensive puzzle the quickest. The winning peer obtains the right to update the state of the network (i.e. write the next transaction in the ledger) and broadcast that update for the rest of the peers to validate for correctness. Once the work is proved to be correct, the peer receives (i.e. mines) a token from the protocol as a reward.",en,GLOSSETA-PROD,general
application/json,beacon chain, "Beacon chain is an improvement to the Ethereum network introduced in the first stage of ETH2.0. The Beacon Chain introduces a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism to the network which allows ETH holders to stake their ETH and become validators in ETH2.0. This enables validators to validate and confirm transactions on the network. ",en,GLOSSETA-PROD,general
application/json,proof of stake, "Proof of stake(PoS) is a consensus mechanism based on financial deposit (i.e. stake) of the native token of a given blockchain to uphold the security and integrity of that chain. Staking a specific amount of token makes one a validator for a given chain, whose responsibility it is to propose and vote on new state transitions (i.e. blocks). Validators are rewarded with the native token of the chain upon the submission of successful blocks; however, if a validator is deemed a bad actor, they are punished by losing their deposited token.",en,GLOSSETA-PROD,general
application/json,public key,"A public key is an alphanumerical series of characters that acts as a mechanism, when used in conjunction with a private key, to provide a means signing transactions and verifying oneself on a blockchain. Every public key is created from a corresponding private key in such a manner where the two are exclusively tied together. That is no other private key can create that same public key.

application/json,private key,"A private key is an alphanumerical series of characters that can thought of as the password to your digital goods and tokens in your wallet. It is the key that unlocks your assets and the mechanism in web3 that grants you ownership of the assets that belong to you. Just as with a password, one must keep their private key hidden from the public and stored away from anything that connects to the internet (i.e. written down on a piece of paper and stored in a safe).
