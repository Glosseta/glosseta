Welcome to the Glosseta website repo!  What is Glosseta you ask?  Great question, Glosseta is new internet's (i.e. web3) glossary for definition for common crypto lingo, terms and slang you may see floating out on various social media platforms and elsewhere on the web.  What sets Glosseta apart from the rest is that the definitions you see on the site are stored themselves on the [Arweave storage protocol](https://www.arweave.org) meaning they will live forever on the decentralized web.  It's our secret sauce for what puts the meta in Glosseta and for what makes us a great companion in your explorations in web3.
