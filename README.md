Welcome to the Glosseta website repo!  What is Glosseta you ask?  Great question, Glosseta is new internet's (i.e. web3) glossary for common crypto lingo, terms, people, applications, etc... you may see floating out on various social media platforms and elsewhere on the web.  What sets Glosseta apart from the rest is that the definitions you see on the site are stored themselves on the [Arweave storage protocol](https://www.arweave.org) meaning they will live forever on the decentralized web.  It's our secret sauce for what puts the meta in Glosseta and for what makes us a great companion in your explorations in web3 no matter you skill level.  We hope to be your long term companion on your Web3 journey and look to be the principal means of demystifying the awesome future we are all looking to build.

## How do terms get uploaded?

Ah so you want to know the recipe to our secret sauce eh?  Well sure, Glosseta is all about open source and stores all the definitions currently in it's knowledge bank in `resources/master_term_bank_en.csv`.  A companion script called the [arweave-json-uploader](https://github.com/narbs91/arweave-json-uploader) created by yours truly (@narbs91) is used to upload this data to the Arweave network in bulk fashion.  Though uploading data to the network does cost AR token (and I have been using my own funds to upload), the costs so far to upload 20 terms onto the network has cost in the total range of micro-pennies which is a wonderful feature in itself ðŸ˜Ž
